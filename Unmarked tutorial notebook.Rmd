This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

**Beginning of actual file:**
The code here is based on the "Modeling and mapping species distributions" tutorial by Richard Chandler (2019): _https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unmarked/vignettes/spp-dist.pdf_

First we load the crossbill data, which contains the detection/non-detection data and covariates.
The dataset actually contains data from multiple years, but we are only going to analyze data from
the first year, 1999. A multi-year analysis of occupancy dynamics could be accomplished using the
colext function, and in addition to mapping occurrence probability, it would be possible to also map
colonization and extinction probabilities. The following commands format the data.

```{r}
data(crossbill)
umf <- unmarkedFrameOccu(y=as.matrix(crossbill[,c("det991", "det992", "det993")]), siteCovs=crossbill[,c("ele", "forest")],
                         obsCovs=list(date=crossbill[,c("date991", "date992", "date993")]))
sc <- scale(siteCovs(umf))
siteCovs(umf) <- sc
```
Notice that the site covariates, elevation and forest, were standardized using the scale function.
Standardization isn’t always necessary, but it can make it easier to find the maximum likelihood
estimates. When standardizing covariates and then making predictions, it is important to retain the
original sample mean and standard deviation. The reason for this is explained below.

Fitting a model is now straight-forward. In many cases, we would fit several models corresponding
to competing hypotheses, but for simplicity, we stick with this single model.

```{r}
(fm.occu <- occu(~date ~ele + I(ele^2) + forest, umf))
```

Now that we have our fitted model, we can use it to predict occurrence probability at each pixel
in the Swiss landscape. The Switzerland dataset contains country-wide data. There are many ways
to display it—here is an example of mapping elevation using the levelplot function in the lattice
package (Sarkar, 2008).

> Sarkar, D., 2008. Lattice: Multivariate Data Visualization with R. Springer, New York. ISBN
978-0-387-75968-5.

```{r}
data(Switzerland)
print(levelplot(elevation ~ x + y, Switzerland, aspect="iso", xlab="Easting (m)", ylab="Northing (m)",
                col.regions=terrain.colors(100)))
```

The raster package (Hijmans, 2019) provides another alternative. Here we create two raster objects 
and specify the coordinate system.

> Hijmans, R. J., 2019. raster: Geographic Data Analysis and Modeling. R package version 3.0-7.
  https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster

```{r}
library(raster)
elevation <- rasterFromXYZ(Switzerland[,c("x","y","elevation")],
                           crs="+proj=somerc +lat_0=46.95240555555556 +lon_0=7.439583333333333 +k_0=1 +x_0=600000 +y_0=200000 +ellps=bessel +towgs84=674.374,15.056,405.346,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs")
forest <- rasterFromXYZ(Switzerland[,c("x","y","forest")],
                        crs="+proj=somerc +lat_0=46.95240555555556 +lon_0=7.439583333333333 +k_0=1 +x_0=600000 +y_0=200000 +ellps=bessel +towgs84=674.374,15.056,405.346,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs")
```

Since we standardized the covariates during the model fitting process, we need to transform the
country-wide data using the same values. Note, we don’t want to use the mean and SD of the rasters
themselves, we want to use the mean and SD of the original covariates used to fit the models, which
are stored as attributes of the sc object. The following commands display the original means and
SDs and then transform the rasters and join them in a raster “stack.”

```{r}
attr(sc, "scaled:center")
# ele forest
# 1189.32584 34.74532
attr(sc, "scaled:scale")
# ele forest
# 640.71471 27.67431
ele.s <- (elevation-1189)/640
forest.s <- (forest-34.7)/27.7
ef <- stack(ele.s, forest.s)
names(ef) <- c("ele", "forest")
plot(ef, col=terrain.colors(100))
```

It is important to assign names that exactly match the covariate names used to fit the model.
This is required by the predict function as demonstrated later. The predict function is useful for
computing spatially-referenced model predictions, standard errors, and confidence intervals, but it is
computationally demanding when there are many pixels in the raster. 

```{r}
(beta <- coef(fm.occu, type="state"))
#  psi(Int) psi(ele) psi(I(ele^2)) psi(forest)
#  0.4638233 1.2276426 -1.3327186 0.6544976
logit.psi <- beta[1] + beta[2]*ele.s + beta[3]*ele.s^2 + beta[4]*forest.s
psi <- exp(logit.psi) / (1 + exp(logit.psi))
```

Thus, if measures of uncertainty are not required, the following code can be used to quickly produce a 
species distribution map:
```{r}
plot(psi, col=terrain.colors(100))
print(spplot(psi, col.regions=terrain.colors(100)))
```

As of version 0.9-6, the predict method in unmarked can make predictions using an object of
class RasterStack from the raster package. As mentioned previously, the rasters must be named,
perhaps by using the names(someraster) <- somename method. The object returned by predict is
another raster stack with rasters for the expected values of the parameter of interest, the standard 
errors, and the upper and lower confidence intervals. The following example is very slow because
there are many thousands of pixels in the raster. The resulting map is shown:
```{r}
E.psi <- predict(fm.occu, type="state", newdata=ef)
plot(E.psi, axes=FALSE, col=terrain.colors(100))

```

**NOTE:** Users should be cautious when predicting from models that have categorical predictor variables,
i.e. factors. The raster package does not have advanced methods for handling factors, and thus
it is not easy to automatically create dummy variables from them as can typically be done using
model.matrix. The safest option is to create the dummy variables manually before fitting the models,
and to use the same variables as rasters for prediction.

**Mapping Population Density**

In this example, we create a distribution map for the Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis),
which is restricted to Santa Cruz Island, California. To do so, we fit the hierarchical distance sampling
model of Royle et al. (2004), which allows for the estimation of abundance in each of the 300 × 300m
pixels representing the island. The data were collected 307, 300-m radius point count (or “point
transect”) surveyed during the Fall of 2008.

> Royle, J. A., D. K. Dawson, and S. Bates, 2004. Modeling abundance effects in distance sampling.
_Ecology_ *85*:1591–1597.

Although we are fitting a model of population density, the steps of the analysis closely mirror
those shown in the previous section. First, we format the data and fit a model, then we format the
island-wide covariates and make predictions. The three covariates thought to influence jay abundance
are elevation, forest cover, and chaparral cover. We also include the area of the survey plots in the 
analysis so that we can make predictions for regions of any area. Here is the code to format the data and 
fit the model.

```{r}
data(issj)
covs <- scale(issj[,c("elevation", "forest", "chaparral")])
area <- pi*300^2 / 10000
jayumf <- unmarkedFrameDS(y=as.matrix(issj[,1:3]), siteCovs=data.frame(covs, area), dist.breaks=c(0,100,200,300), 
                          unitsIn="m", survey="point")

fm1 <- distsamp(~chaparral ~chaparral + elevation + offset(log(area)), jayumf, keyfun="halfnorm", output="abund",
                starts=c(-2.8,1,0,4.5,0))
fm1
```

Remarks: 1) The distance data were binned into 3 distance classes. 2) We used output="abund"
even though, by specifying the offset, we effectively modeled population density. As stated previously,
this allows us to make predictions of abundance for regions of arbitrary size.

The next thing to do is to format the raster data. For details, see the previous section—the
process is the same, except that we need a raster for “area”, the size of each pixel in the raster data.
This is necessary because the survey plots were larger than the pixels for which we want predictions
of abundance.

```{r}
data(cruz)
elev <- rasterFromXYZ(cruz[,c("x","y","elevation")], crs="+proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs")
forest <- rasterFromXYZ(cruz[,c("x","y","forest")], crs="+proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs")
chap <- rasterFromXYZ(cruz[,c("x","y","chaparral")], crs="+proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs")
area.raster <- chap
values(area.raster) <- 300*300/10000 # area of a grid pixel
attr(covs, "scaled:center")
# elevation    forest     chaparral
# 202.0023616  0.0673357  0.2703592
attr(covs, "scaled:scale")
# elevation    forest     chaparral
# 124.8818069  0.1368199  0.2338295
elev.s <- (elev-202)/125
forest.s <- (forest-0.0673)/0.137
chap.s <- (chap-0.270)/0.234
habitat <- stack(elev.s, forest.s, chap.s, area.raster)
names(habitat) <- c("elevation", "forest", "chaparral", "area")
```

Now, when we use predict, it will return the expected number of jays in each pixel along with
the standard errors and the 95% confidence intervals. We could sum these up to obtain an estimate
of total population size. Sillett et al. (In press) did this and used the parametric boostrap to estimate
the variance of total population size.
